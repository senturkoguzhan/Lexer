# Lexer

### Description
For this project, I implemented lexer that does the tokenization of any set of valid G++ expressions or statements in Lisp and using Flex.

### Usage
You can two options for lexical analysis,
  * Lisp
    * Write terminal _gpp_lexer.lisp_ to run.
    * helloworld.g++ is a document to do lexical analysis.(You can change this document another test)
   * Flex
     * Write the following in the terminal respectively _lex ggp_lexer.l_ , _gcc lex.yy.c_ , ./a.out to run
     * This program runs like a interpreter, expect inputs to do lexical analysis.
     
### RoadMap
  This project has important lack. This version can not detect syntax error. I will implement error mechanisim as soon as possible.
  If you want contribute to me for this problem , please contact me.
